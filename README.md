# Bay Area Internships

<img src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/22844059/66704823-47eea980-ece5-11e9-917e-7719ffd26b85.png" alt="elenalape" width="500"/>

This is a list of large tech companies or their subsidiaries that can (in theory) hire non-US summer interns in the Bay Area.

Internships are 3-month long interviews. It's hard for non-US citizens to find US-based internships because after your "interview" finishes, converting you into a full-time employee is difficult due to visa uncertainties and lotteries. If the company is international and/or highly distributed, you have a much higher chance of being hired as an intern in the Bay Area as you could then just go and work from one of their offices outside of the US, if successful.

I want to share the list I made that I referred to in Autumn 2018 when looking for summer internships in the States.

If you'd like to add something in here, or update a non-international company, Pull Requests and Issues are very much accepted!

## Internship Programs

Below are a list of vetted organizations that help new grads connect with a pool of companies (as a middle-man). Usually, the internship programs help arrange for flights, accomodation, visa sponsorship, and all other things that are needed to work in the U.S. (SSN, Bank accounts). The applicant applies to the internship program, which does an initial screening, and which then coordinates interviews with a pool of suitable companies.


### Silicon Valley Internship program (SVIP)

The [SVIP](https://siliconvalleyinternship.com) program gives newly graduating Software Engineering Students the unique experience of working with hot tech companies in Silicon Valley through a one-year internship. Successful applicants are matched with a high growth tech company and work as an integral part of their engineering teams.
In addition, the SVIP hosts monthly ‘Meet the Entrepreneur’ and ‘Hackathon’ events, which take the SVIPers through the company formation process from idea to revenue.

SVIP is a great choice for engineers with an entrepreneurial spirit, that want to challenge themselves and learn from high-growth startups.
